Eureka! Clinical Analytics ${project.version} -- An ETL Tool for Loading Data into
i2b2.  Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Eureka! It provides an easy way to load clinical datasets
into an instance of i2b2, a clinical database query tool. This project
is sponsored by the CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG), an NHLBI
grant for creating informatics infrastructure in support of
cardiovascular research.

WHAT'S NEW

Version ${project.version} provides the following changes:

- Ability to directly connect to databases and data warehouses as sources of
patient data
- Improvements to the phenotype editor

Version 1.7 added Liquibase support for database migrations and additional data
element editor features. You can specify frequencies of consecutive data elements
 for any data element now. You also can specify value thresholds that are 
specific to a disease or condition.

Version 1.6 extended the rudimentary data element editing support
provided in version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You
can specify a relatively complete set of the temporal patterns that
can be specified in the underlying Protempa software.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is
expected to work with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java
7 due to incompatibility of some of its dependencies. We intend to support 
Java 7 in a future release.
