Eureka! Clinical Analytics 1.6.1 -- An ETL Tool for Loading Data into
i2b2.
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Eureka! It provides an easy way to load clinical datasets
into an instance of i2b2, a clinical database query tool. This project
is sponsored by the CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG), an NHLBI
grant for creating informatics infrastructure in support of
cardiovascular research.

WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.6.1 is a bug fix release. It fixes the following issues:
1) Registration verification email contains the wrong URL.
2) In the data element editor, the property list is not populated 
when editing a data element in which a property constraint already
has been specified.

Version 1.6 extends the rudimentary data element editing support
provided in version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You
can specify a relatively complete set of the temporal patterns that
can be specified in the underlying Protempa software.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is
expected to work with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java
7 due to incompatibility of some of its dependencies. We intend to support 
Java 7 in a future release.
