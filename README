WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.9 includes an update to the UI, now using Bootstrap 3, 
to make the application more usable on mobile devices.  It also 
includes support for i2b2 1.7.  A new feature to allow usage of 
BioPortal for ontologies was added.  The codebase was also updated 
to utilize Java 7.  A data element search functionality was 
added to the phenotype editor and job submission screens.  Eureka! 
can now utilize OAuth as an authentication mechanism, allowing 
the use of services like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, and other 
to log into the system.  Finally, many improvements were made 
to ease the process of installing and configuring the software.

patient data

Version 1.7 added Liquibase support for database migrations and additional data
element editor features. You can specify frequencies of consecutive data elements
 for any data element now. You also can specify value thresholds that are 
specific to a disease or condition.

provided in version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You
