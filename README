Eureka! Clinical Analytics 1.6 -- An ETL Tool for Loading Data into i2b2.
Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University

OVERVIEW

Welcome to Eureka! It provides an easy way to load clinical datasets into an 
instance of i2b2, a clinical database query tool. This project is sponsored by 
the CardioVascular Research Grid (CVRG), an NHLBI grant for creating 
informatics infrastructure in support of cardiovascular research.

This package contains source code only. For binaries, please go to

WHAT'S NEW

Version 1.6 extends the rudimentary data element editing support provided in
version 1.5 to provide a complete data element editor. You can specify a 
relatively complete set of the temporal patterns that can be specified in the
underlying Protempa software.

REQUIREMENTS

The current version is known to work with Oracle Java 6. It is expected to work
with OpenJDK 6 as well. It is incompatible with Java 7. 

Eureka! Clinical Analytics uses the Maven build system, available from 
http://maven.apache.org. You must install maven, if you do not already have it,
to work with the source code. We use Maven 3.

INSTALLATION

Once compiled, please see http://eureka-dev.cci.emory.edu/dev for detailed
